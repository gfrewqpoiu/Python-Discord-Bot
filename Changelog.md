##Changelog

3.2.0 Added some commands to just download files with youtube.dl without needing rclone configured. Also updated requirements.txt which should make installation much easier. These commands require youtube-dl which is **NOT** in the requirements.txt bc Linux and macOS should use the one from their package repo/homebrew.
