Discord Random Bot

This is a Discord Bot for me to experiment a bit and learn some Python along the way. 

If you want to use it clone the project, make a copy of config_example.ini to config.ini and enter your credentials there.

Requirements:
* Python >=3.6
* discord.py

Optional:
* pyrandom (Adds support for random.org)
* google-api-python-client (Adds Image Search commands)
